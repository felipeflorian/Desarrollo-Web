# Gamer match

A online application that provides a simple LogIn/SignUp, as well as a main web page that displays the application's features, such as top players and games (extracted from a dummy database), about, the first page, and profile, where the user password can be changed.


ReactJS, NodeJS, and mongoDB were used to create it.
ReactJS is used for the frontend, using CSS for styling, and express and mongoDB are utilized for the backend.
The frontend is entirely functional, however the backend lacks security.


This project was completed as part of the web development course at Rosario University in Colombia.
